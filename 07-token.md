# 🪙 HashKomodo Token Utility

The **HashKomodo Token** is the central utility and governance token of the HashKomodo ecosystem, created on **Hedera Hashgraph**. It is designed with care to avoid speculative traps and regulatory complications, offering real, usable in-world value tied directly to the game, lore, and community governance.

## 🌱 Why Hedera?

HashKomodo Token is natively launched on **Hedera Hashgraph** due to its:

* High throughput and low-cost transactions
* Environmentally sustainable architecture
* Native compatibility with our long-term lore (Gen 0 and Gen 9 both anchor to Hedera)

This ensures the token remains eco-conscious and efficient for frequent game interactions.

In the future, thanks to Hedera’s interoperability efforts—such as its integration with **Chainlink CCIP**—HashKomodo Token may also become accessible across multiple chains, further reinforcing our vision of a **multichain ecosystem** guided by story-first design.

## ⚠️ Strategic Disclaimers

* There is **no NFT burn mechanism** — progression is handled via *recharging* and *cooldown models* instead.
* Token is **not used** as direct payment for NFT minting.
* There is **no airdrop**; distribution aligns with gameplay and staking mechanics.
* All reward models are **utility-first**, not profit-seeking.

---

## 📆 Launch Timeline

HashKomodo Token is planned to launch between:

* **Gen 3 (Ethereum)**: Governance seeds and reputation-based access
* **Gen 4 (BNB Chain)**: Dynamic trait modules and power-based utilities

This ensures the token enters the ecosystem **in sync** with DAO rollout and advanced game mechanics.
