# 🧑‍🚀 Team & Contributors (Alias-Based)

HashKomodo is currently led by a core team of contributors using creative aliases, with experience in digital art, blockchain development, lore writing, and community building. This structure allows focus on creative execution and ecosystem expansion—without bias toward public profiles or geographic constraints.
