# ⚖️ Legal & Compliance Disclaimer (Non-Binding)

HashKomodo is a creative and entertainment project built around digital collectibles, lore, and gameplay. We are not a financial institution, nor do we offer financial products, securities, or investment vehicles.

## 🚫 Not Financial Advice

None of the content within HashKomodo—including but not limited to NFTs, tokens, artwork, metadata, and lore—should be interpreted as financial advice. Participation in any phase of this project is purely voluntary and intended for entertainment, artistic engagement, and optional gameplay utility.

> *Buy, collect, or participate only if you understand the risks involved with digital assets.*

---

## 🛡 Regulatory Awareness

HashKomodo is aware of ongoing global developments regarding digital assets. Our project design seeks to avoid classification as a financial security by:

* Avoiding promises of **profit**, **returns**, or **passive income**
* Structuring the token as a **utility token** only
* Offering NFTs with **no guarantee of future value**
* Keeping game mechanics **non-extractive and skill-based**

We monitor global standards such as the **Howey Test**, and take into account interpretations by regulators like the **U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)** and other international authorities.

All mechanics and claims are designed to reflect a compliance-first mindset.

## 📦 NFT Classification

HashKomodo NFTs are intended as digital collectibles with optional lore and in-game features. They do **not** represent ownership in a business, profit-sharing, voting shares, or equity. Their value, if any, is derived from artistic, narrative, and social attributes.

---

## 🪙 Token Utility Clarification

HashKomodo will introduce a token in the future for:

* In-game mechanics (XP, level-up, item unlock)
* DAO governance (TBA)
* Community engagement modules

The token will not represent revenue share, equity, or claim on treasury funds.

---

## 💸 Royalty Clarity

Where applicable, NFT royalties are distributed **not as profit sharing**, but as part of a creative ownership framework to incentivize community participation. No holder is entitled to income or dividends.

---

## 🔄 Roadmap & Forward-Looking Statements

All timelines, features, and mechanics described in this whitepaper are **subject to change**. No roadmap item should be interpreted as a guarantee or binding delivery commitment. We reserve the right to adapt the project based on creative, technical, and legal evolution.

---

## 🌍 Jurisdiction & User Responsibility

This project is not intended for users or participants located in jurisdictions where digital collectibles or tokens are restricted. It is your responsibility to comply with your local laws and consult legal professionals if necessary.

> *HashKomodo is a decentralized art and narrative project, not a financial product.*
