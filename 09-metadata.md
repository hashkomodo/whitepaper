# 🧬 Metadata & Traits (TBA)

This section outlines the current metadata structure for **Gen 0 (Founder's Egg)** and introduces how traits will evolve across generations. While Gen 0 is a static NFT, its **Lore Class** plays a foundational role in shaping all future roles, elements, and gameplay dynamics in the HashKomodo multiverse.

## 📦 Gen 0 Metadata Overview

All Founder's Egg NFTs are static and launched on **Hedera**, with metadata embedded following HIP-412 standard.

Gen 0 traits are divided into two categories:

### 🎨 Visual Traits

These traits define the appearance of the Founder's Egg NFT:

* **Shell Type**
* **Shell Color Name**
* **Background Color Name**
* **Crack Pattern**
* **Markings**
* **Glow Core**
* **Aura**

Each trait contributes to the visual identity of your egg. Though not directly used in gameplay, these traits form collectible identity and may influence cosmetic elements in the future.

### 🧬 Non-Visual Traits

These traits carry the narrative, rarity, and game influence:

* **Lore Class**
  The spiritual bloodline of your Egg. Determines future role affinity, element class, and trait lineage in Gen 1 and beyond.

* **Rarity Tier**
  Overall rarity grouping based on total trait composition. Tiers help determine distribution balance and future unlock potential.

> Example Lore Classes include: *Egg of Fire*, *Egg of Void*, *Egg of Depths*, *Egg of Eclipse*, and others.

## 📖 Format & Compatibility

* Designed for **intergenerational trait referencing**
* Future Gen (1+) will add dynamic metadata for:

  * Power / XP / Skill Trees
  * Battle Role / Element / Cooldown

## 🔄 Future Trait Integration

While Gen 0 remains **static**, its metadata is:

* Referenced in **Gen 1+ metadata lineage**
* Used in **breeding & fusion logic**
* Integrated into **card game role assignment**
* Potentially cosmetic-layered in **VR/AR or merch**

> “In HashKomodo, traits are more than visuals—they are fragments of legacy.”
