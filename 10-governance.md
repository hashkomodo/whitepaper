# 🏛 Governance & Community (TBA)

HashKomodo envisions a governance structure that is *narrative-aligned, community-driven*, and gradually activated as the ecosystem expands. Governance is not just a mechanism for decision-making—it is a living layer of lore and collective power.

---

## 🔮 DAO Vision

HashKomodo will introduce an **evolving DAO model** that grows alongside the multiverse. This system will allow verified community members and token holders to:

* Propose new **expansion directions**
* Vote on **merchandise collaborations**
* Influence **KomodoCon locations or agendas**
* Prioritize **lore forks or side quests**

The DAO will not be controlled by whales or short-term hype. Instead, it will gradually integrate:

* *Token-weighted voting*
* *Reputation-based participation badges*
* Lore alignment through staking or engagement

> **Phase 1** of DAO will prioritize Gen 0 holders and early contributors.

## 🎭 Community Role

From day one, HashKomodo has emphasized that *community is not audience—it is co-author.*

Community members can:

* Participate in lore worldbuilding events
* Join playtesting for modules or expansions
* Receive NFT badges for contribution in art, lore, or mechanics
* Co-host real-world meetups or virtual campaigns

Platforms used for community development include:

* **Discord**: Lore council, voice chat, announcement hub
* **Telegram**: Quest drops, TON mini-game integrations
* **Twitter/X**: Highlights, voting polls, memes
* **GitHub (TBA)**: Proposal board and lore fork system

## 🛡 Governance Structure (TBA)

The full DAO rollout will be introduced *after the launch of the HashKomodo Token*. The model will likely include:

* **Council System**: Nominated lore leaders or role masters
* **Open Proposal Board**: With seasonal voting windows
* **Reputation Points**: Earned through verified in-ecosystem actions

> The governance will never be a passive airdrop mechanism. It is a **strategic tool for guardianship**.

## 📍 What’s Next?

Once the HashKomodo Token is deployed (between **Gen 3–Gen 4**), the governance engine will gradually activate. Initial voting might include:

* Prioritizing expansion modules
* Lore direction for Gen 5–6
* Selecting animation themes or artists

**This document will be updated post-token launch** to reflect the actual proposal framework, on-chain tools, and DAO governance milestones.

> *HashKomodo isn’t governed by the loudest voice—but by the deepest lore alignment.*
