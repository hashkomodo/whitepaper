# 🕹️ Gameplay Overview

The HashKomodo card battle system is not just a mini-game—it is a core pillar of the **KomodoVerse experience**. Built on lore, layered with strategy, and designed for long-term progression, gameplay in HashKomodo blends **PvE quests**, **PvP battles**, and **lore-driven mechanics** into one evolving arena.

Whether you're commanding a Primal Komodo, deploying Rift Relics, or activating a Void-born trap, every move reflects your NFT lineage and narrative path.

## 🧠 Gameplay Design Philosophy

HashKomodo’s game loop draws from the most successful elements in physical and digital card games—while avoiding common pitfalls. It’s designed not just for entertainment, but for narrative immersion, strategic growth, and collectible interoperability.

### ✅ What We Embrace:

* **Ownership-first mechanics** powered by blockchain
* **XP-based character growth** tied to lore and history
* **Faction and role identity** that affects game logic
* **Accessible PvE mode** for casual storytelling and onboarding
* **Deep PvP systems** to encourage mastery and clan dynamics
* **Utility-based expansions** to enrich meta and keep gameplay fresh

### 🚫 What We Avoid:

* No *pay-to-win*: Power is earned, not bought
* No *shallow auto-battle*: Strategy matters, not idle clicks
* No *chain-locking*: Game is multichain-native, narrative-bound
* No *aesthetic-only NFTs*: Every item has purpose in the lore

HashKomodo learns from industry benchmarks—but builds its own legend through story-first design.

## 🧩 Core Gameplay Modes

HashKomodo’s gameplay will revolve around two key modes:

* **PvE (Player vs Environment)**
  Face off against corrupted species, rogue clans, and void creatures. Questlines and campaigns are linked to your NFT’s lore class and bloodline.

* **PvP (Player vs Player)**
  Challenge other Komodo holders in ranked duels, tournaments, or future **clan wars**. Card synergy, rarity, and role all influence outcomes.

Both modes will offer **battle rewards**, item drops, and progression systems.

## 🎴 Card Battle System

At its heart, HashKomodo is a **card-based tactical game**. Each Komodo NFT can be represented by a card containing:

* Role (e.g. Seer, Raider, Sentinel)
* Element (Fire, Void, Earth, etc.)
* Energy, Cooldown, and Power Levels
* Passive Traits and Skill Triggers

Decks are formed from:

* **Komodo NFTs** (main characters)
* **Expansion Sets** (relics, trap cards, mutation tools)
* **Battle Gear** (soulbound or tradable items)

---

## ⚔️ Combat & Progression

Each battle is turn-based, influenced by:

* Trait synergy
* Lore class alignment
* Card rarity
* Strategic combo timing

Players gain **XP**, unlock badges, and progress through rank tiers. Power does not solely come from rarity—but from tactical deployment and narrative alignment.

## 🎖️ Utility of NFTs in Gameplay

Every HashKomodo NFT has in-game relevance:

* **All PFP Generations (Gen 1 and beyond)** → core battle units in PvE and PvP
* **Expansion Sets** → gear, trap, map, relic, or fusion items
* **Relics** → passive boosts or crafting keys
* **Badges** → progression and access rights

This makes the HashKomodo ecosystem fully playable, not just collectible. While **Gen 0 Founder's Eggs** are not used in battle directly, they define the bloodline and influence gameplay traits across generations.

> *"Victory belongs not to the rarest card, but to the bloodline that remembers its origin."*
