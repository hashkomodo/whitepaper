# 🌿 Conservation Impact (Vision-Driven)

Komodo dragons are not just mythical beasts in HashKomodo lore—they are real, endangered, and need urgent awareness. Our project began with a simple belief: *Web3 can be more than art and speculation—it can preserve stories and species.*

---

## 🧭 Why Conservation Matters

The Komodo dragon is classified as **Endangered** by the IUCN, with threats including climate change, habitat loss, and reduced genetic diversity. Yet globally, they remain one of the most underrepresented species in conservation media.

HashKomodo aims to use the power of storytelling, digital assets, and community coordination to drive lasting attention to this iconic species.

> We don’t just collect Komodos—we remember them, mythologize them, and protect what they represent.

## 📅 Our Long-Term Commitment

HashKomodo’s conservation initiative is built around a 3-phase strategy:

1. **Awareness through Lore & Art**
   Building cultural memory through NFTs, character depth, and educational storytelling

2. **Digital Collaboration** *(TBA)*
   Partnering with creators, eco-NGOs, or institutions for digital campaigns and funding experiments

3. **On-the-Ground Action** *(Future Phase)*
   Exploring ways to support habitat restoration, tagging, or sponsorship programs near Komodo National Park

This approach allows flexibility without overpromising results.

## 🔍 What Conservation Might Look Like

While we’re still in the early stage of execution, we’re considering:

* **Komodo Pass NFTs** for eco-tourism partnerships
* **Educational campaigns** about biodiversity in Southeast Asia
* **KomodoCon Panels** with conservation speakers and stakeholders
* **Story-based Activism Quests** (lore modules with real-world call-to-action)

We also welcome **open collaboration** with environmental and educational institutions.

## 🛡 Responsible Framing

We believe conservation should be done **with transparency and ethics**, not hype:

* No claims of automatic donation from mint funds
* No promises of fixed percentage allocation
* No misleading “eco” label without traceability

> Conservation is not a marketing tool—it’s a responsibility that unfolds with time and sincerity.

---

## 📍 Status: To Be Announced

Our conservation modules will be gradually introduced during **Phase IV and Beyond** of the roadmap. These include:

* Verified partnership launches (TBA)
* Lore-infused campaign drops
* Hybrid IRL/URL events in the region

We’re here to build more than just a collection—we’re building cultural relevance for Komodo dragons in the digital era.

> *Conservation in HashKomodo is not a gimmick—it’s the soul behind the story.*
