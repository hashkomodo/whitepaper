# 🧠 Tech Stack & Infrastructure (TBA)

HashKomodo is built on a foundation of *modular architecture*, *open tooling*, and *chain-agnostic scalability*. As a living multiverse, our tech stack evolves to support storytelling, gameplay, and community governance without being locked into a single standard.

---

## 🧱 Core Technology Principles

* **Multichain flexibility** (Hedera, EVM-compatible, and L2-ready)
* **Open-source modularity** for game, lore, and DAO
* **JSON-first metadata system** designed for long-term NFT evolvability
* **Player & lore-centric logic**, not market-centric

---

## ⚙️ Current Infrastructure

* **Blockchain Layer**: Hedera (HIP-412 for Gen 0)
* **Metadata**: Static JSON (Gen 0), with planned evolution into dynamic schemas
* **File Hosting**: IPFS (image & metadata files)
* **Frontend**: Next.js, Tailwind CSS
* **Backend/API**: Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL (TBA for gameplay backend)
* **Docs & Wiki**: GitBook (whitepaper), GitHub (public proposal repo TBA)

> *HashKomodo prioritizes transparency, speed, and environmental responsibility in its infrastructure.*

## 🎮 Game Modules & Engine

The card game and PvE modules are being developed as **game-engine agnostic**, using:

* Modular **battle engine** with NFT metadata input (TBA)
* Trait-based calculation using XP, Power, Role, Element
* PvE logic served through **syncable off-chain JSON + chain state**
* PvP & Clan Wars structure: TBA (Phase III–IV)

---

## 🗳 DAO & Governance Tools *(TBA)*

We are exploring:

* Snapshot, Realms, or custom voting tools for DAO proposal flow
* Role-based access layer integrated with NFT ownership and badges
* Progressive reputation system linked to ecosystem contribution

DAO tooling will begin rollout after the launch of the HashKomodo Token between **Gen 3–4**.

---

## 🌐 VR, AR, and Mini-Game Integration *(Phase IV+)*

HashKomodo will gradually integrate:

* **AR experiences** tied to location or lore
* **VR modules** for world exploration and event hosting
* **TON-based mini games** (Telegram native)
* **Spatial / Metaverse crossover modules** (TBA)

> *We build for now, but architect for the future.*

---

## 🔓 Open Source Commitment

Select parts of our ecosystem—such as lore tooling, proposal templates, and non-proprietary governance components—may be **open sourced** to support builders and collaborative innovation. Core systems like the card game engine and proprietary gameplay logic will remain **closed-source** to preserve competitive integrity and IP strategy. GitHub modules will be announced progressively with clear licensing.

---

## 📍 Status: Modular & Evolving

This document reflects the live tech direction as of Gen 0. It will be updated alongside:

* Game engine public alpha
* DAO structure finalization
* Multichain deployment expansion

> *Technology is not the limit in HashKomodo—it’s the enabler of evolution.*
